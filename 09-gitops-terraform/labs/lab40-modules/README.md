# Modules

Although Terraform is not the most expressive programming language, it allows easy
creation of libraries called *modules*. In fact, any directory with `.tf` files on
it can be considered one and invoked from other module.

Modules can also be automatically downloaded from any git repository, from GitHub or
from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). And
`terraform init` is intelligent enough to download the chain of dependencies.

In a module, the variables become the block properties and the outputs can be
used as output parameters.

Read the code in the [src](src/) directory and see how we don't need to explicitly
declare any direct provider. See also the correct way of referring to a particular
module (using the `source` property of the `module` block) and how to use the
output parameters (as presented in the [output.tf](src/outputs.tf) file).

*Note*: this particular module is using local sources and, because of that, it is not
possible (literally) to use a specific version of it. That is not the case in most
scenarios, as described in the [module sourcedocumentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#selecting-a-revision).

## Exercise

Feel free to `init` and `apply` the code of the laboratory. Pay attention to the output
generated by the module.
