## What is serverless?

Consider “serverless” as:
A mindset, an approach, a practice, a culture, a way of working
Focus on business value, rather than the enabling technology

**Benefits:**

- Faster time to market from prototype to production
- Rapid, continuous experimentation and feedback
- React and deliver business changes with a product mindset
- Serverless = the best way to build and run modern applications

**“Serverless” architecture is an operational model**
Minimize taking on ongoing operational tasks, outsource system administration tasks
Every non-serverless component = ongoing ops responsibility
Optimize for long-term maintainability
Serverless does not mean "No Ops“!

AWS as your platform (engineering) team
Build “in” the cloud, not just “on” it

## Event Driven Architectures

## Serverless/EDA trade-offs

- Different way of designing applications
- More moving pieces
- Harder to understand dependencies
- Eventual consistency
- Different testing/monitoring/observability
- Relying on platform capabilities and security

## Serverless Best practices

- Consider “serverless” as a mindset
- Focus on business value, rather than the enabling technology
- Optimize for long-term maintainability
- Build “in” the cloud, not just “on” it
- Concentrate on the flow of data and events = EDA
- Create enabling platform teams
- Think serverless first
