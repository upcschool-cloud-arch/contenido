# Architecture challenge

## First part

The new version of the Aldebaran Beauty ecommerce is going full steam ahead.
Customers access a comprehensive platform after identifying themselves, using their 
browser and under a single domain. The main components of it are five applications: 
a static web frontend that invokes the catalog APIs, stock control, shopping cart 
and user management.

Design an architecture that supports this scenario in a secure, reliable and scalable way.

## Second part

Once the shopping cart processes the payment of an order, it becomes part of the
list of orders to distribute. Warehouse employees have an application that allows 
them to package each one into a single bundle, and delivery people have access 
to another option of the same application that gives them the possibility to 
indicate that they have picked it up.

Add the architectural elements that allow implementing this second part of the system 
to the diagram you have created.
